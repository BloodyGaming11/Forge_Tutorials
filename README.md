Forge_Tutorials
===============

Welcome to coolAlias' Minecraft Forge Modding Tutorials!

I've tried to add tutorials for subjects that I either haven't seen elsewhere, needed updating or just needed
further explanation.

Most of my tutorials are NOT set up like full proper code and WILL give you lots of errors if you just
copy and paste it into Eclipse.

That being said, all of the code I provide I have personally used and tested, so if you read all the comments,
follow the directions and do your best to understand what the code is doing, I'm confident you, too, will be
able to get it working.

I'm by no means, however, an expert in Java, so if you are and spot errors in my code or just have a better way
of doing it, then please let me know!

If you have any suggestions on how to make the tutorials more clear, if you have a question or if you just want to
say hi, leave a comment or p.m. me on minecraftforum.net and I'll see what I can do :)
